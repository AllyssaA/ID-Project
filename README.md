# ID-Project

## Introduction

This repository is for a group project part of Information Design from HVA CMD. We've been challenged to convince our target group for the need for climate action by using visual storytelling.


This project has been developed with the following languages:
HTML
CSS
JS

In combination with libraries such as:

[Animation Library Greensock GSAP.](https://greensock.com/)

[LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/) for videos converted to animations.

And a tool written by [@chrisgannon](https://github.com/chrisgannon/ScrollLottie) to iintegrate GSAP's scrollTrigger with a lottie animation

## Documentation
For this project we used Notion to track our process. This is written in Dutch.
